### Glide 2 Exercise Teaching Material

# Teach about getting the x position and y position
From the previous lesson, we found that getting the x position of the sprite was important in many aspects of the doodle jump game.
*Show them the x-position, y-position, and direction blocks*
In Sketch 2 there are ways to identify the x position and y position.

In this exercise, we will practice moving by gliding the cat from one location to another using the arrow keys!

Note that there are some bright orange blocks here.
  Don't worry about those :)
  You will learn about those later!

Here are some instructions, when it moves up, down, left, and right, make sure to move the cat at that direction by 50.

When you move the cat left to right, make sure to change the pointed direction!
*Note that this exercise does not use the direction block :(
