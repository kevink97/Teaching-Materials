variables!

variables are basically ways for the computer to remember values and keep track of things.


Like how you can keep track of how many dots there were after i erase them, computers can do the same.

We will try using variables to build a calculator!

ops = operators

prev = previous numbers.

right now, our calculator can only do 2 number calculation.
You will modify the calculator later so that it can continue calculation with more than 2 numbers.
