HW2

Content:
- if, elif, else
- boolean
- logical operator (and/or/not)
- input
- running your python code (python3 hw2.py)
- inequality

Below are the instructions for the code I want you to write.
0. Save your hw2.py file on the Desktop.
1. Write a line of code that prints: "Hi. I am a pretty cool calculator".
2. Write a line of code that asks the user "Would you like to add(a), multiply(m), or square(s)"
      and save the user's answer into a variable called, operation.

3. if the user entered a or m (add or multiply respectively),
      write a line of code that asks the user: "Tell me the first number"
        and save the user's response into a variable called, first.
      AND
      write a line of code that asks the user: "Tell me the second number"
        and save the user's response into a variable called, second.
      THEN
      do the operations specified by the user (add or multiply)
        then print it out like this: "Here is your answer: [answer]".
4. if the user entered s (square),
      write a line of code that asks the user: "Tell me the number to square"
        and save the user's response into a variable called, num.
      THEN
      do the operation specified by the user (square)
        then print it out like this: "Here is your answer: [answer]".

5. It's time to run your code!
    Go to the command line and go to the file that your python code is at.
    For example, if your python code is on the Desktop, type (with out the less than sign):
        > cd Desktop
        > python3 hw2.py
    Make sure everything is working properly!
