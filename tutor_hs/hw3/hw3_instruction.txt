Review - Lists:
Creating a List:
  l1 = list() # creates an empty list and saves it into variable l
  l2 = ['a', 'b', 1] # creates a list with content 'a', 'b', and 1 in that order.
Accessing List:
  l2[0] #accesses the l2 array at position (index) 0... first element
  x = l2[0] # gets the first element (in this example 'a'), and saves it to x.
            # x is now 'a'
Length/size of a list:
  len(l2) # gets the length of the list
  y = len(l2) # gets the length of the list and stores it in to y.
              # y is now 3
Adding elements to the end (append):
  l1.append(3) # appends the value 3 to the end of the l2 list
               # l1 is now [3]
Inserting elements to a particular position (insert):
  l1.insert(0, 5) # inserts the value 5 at the position 0 (beginnning of the list)
                  # l1 is now [1, 3]
Extending a list:
  l1.extend(l2) # add elements of l2 to the end of l1.
                # l1 = [1, 3, 'a', 'b', 1]
                # note: l2 does not change
Get the position of a particular element:
  l1.index(1) # gets the first occurence of the value 1...so, list.index(1) would give us 0.
Removing elements by element:
  l1.remove(1) # removes the first occurance of the element 1.
                # l1 = [3, 'a', 'b', 1] 
Sorting lists:
  l3 = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
  l3.sort() # this will sort the numbers from smallest to biggest
            # l3 = [1,2,3,4,5]
Reverse list:
  l3.reverse() # this will reverse the elements in the list
              # l3 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Remove element by index:
  z = l3.pop(3) # this will pop the 4th element in the list and save the element into z
                # z = 2 AND l3 = [5, 4, 3, 1]
  c = l3.pop() # this will remove the last element and save the element into c
              # c = 1 AND l3 = [5, 4, 3]

String review:
Lower casing the entire string:
  s = "HELLO"
  s.lower() # s is now "hello"
Upper casing the string:
  s.upper() # s is not "HELLO"
Check what character is at the index:
  c = s[1] # c is "E"
Replace all occurence of a string with somethign else:
  s.replace("L", "K") # s is not HEKKO
Split the string by a delimeter and put it into a list:
  s2 = "Hi I am Bob"
  a = s2.split(" ") # a is now ["hi", "I", "am", "Bob"]

Below are some things you should code up! Do your best! It uses stuff we learned before and Strings and Lists!


-------------------------PROBLEMS---------
PHONE DIRECTORY APP
This will be a phone directory app where we can retrieve phone numbers of people by name
  and retrieve people's name by phone number.

Work on this on hw2-phone.py

Do as told in the code file. REPLACE TODO with your code!
