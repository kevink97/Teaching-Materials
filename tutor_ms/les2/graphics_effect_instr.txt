### Graphics Effect Teaching Material

This exercise is to teach the students how to resize, move to front, and show the sprite.

This exercise is done by playing "hide and seek" with the sprite.
The sprite will try to hide itself amongst the christmas tree and the student will have to hack their way to make the sprite visible.

Make sure to teach them about positioning the sprite and how to show and hide. and adjust the size!!
